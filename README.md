#Webtop#
##(like [top](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Top_%28software%29), but more web-3.0™ )
This is nothing more than a lark, written as an introduction to node - my logic was something like "I don't like UI, or users, but I want to stream real-time data to a bunch of clients. Hm. Top! Also, [Amit did something using paper.js](http://www.meetamit.com/vines/)." So webtop invokes top, parses the output, and sends it to browsers (using [socket.io](http://socket.io/)), whereupon the cpu usage per process is displayed in a nice graph. Sans units or labels, because that's just not web-3.0™. Depends on [beeline](https://github.com/Xavi-/beeline), socket.io, functional.js\*, and paper.js. Grab a copy of paper and place it in static/ to run...

\* An interesting library that I just [forked](https://github.com/matthewSorensen/functional-javascript), because it was super abandoned and had a stupid Rakefile. Makes js much more tolerable...
